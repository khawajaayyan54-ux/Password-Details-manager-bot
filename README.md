# Password-Details-manager-bot
This is an early-stage Python bot that acts like a simple AI assistant for managing and retrieving user information. It reads data from a config file and allows users to access certain information through password-protected commands.

## Features (Current Version)
1. Password-protected access to user information.
2. Commands to retrieve user name, email, password, recent project, and Instagram ID.
3. Predefined commands can bypass password verification.
4. Includes a help menu with all available commands.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. A config.text file with keys like user_name, user_email, user_password.

## Notes
1. This is a prototype; the bot is not fully AI-driven yet.
2. Future improvements may include dynamic responses, better command handling, and JSON/Database integration.
3. Commands not recognized will prompt an error message.
